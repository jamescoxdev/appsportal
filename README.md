### Fun playground for saving your Web Apps (like bookmarking)

This is a fun little project written with React and Redux. It's not complete as you need to add an Auth Provider, as well as a database to store the user profile.

In its current form it will save the "Anonymous" profile and the apps you add to your browsers Local Storage.

### Get Started

1. Clone this repo
2. In a terminal navigate to the repo directory
3. Run npm install
4. Run npm start

Have Fun!
